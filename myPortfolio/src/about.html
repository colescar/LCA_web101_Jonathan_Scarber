    <section><strong></strong> About Me </strong></section>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jonathan "Cole" Scarber, I am a 23 year old from Wichita Falls, Texas, currently residing in Lubbock, Texas. I am a student of Lubbock Coding Academy working towards a Web Development degree. Over the years I have gained many skills in different areas, such as, 9 years of DJ'ing, 6 years of working in a cabinet business run by my father Bobby, and sales jobs ranging from door-to-door sales and in-store sales. </p>
    <p>As a web developer, my goal is to ensure a website exists primarily as a means for growth. It should leverage the business by serving as a tool to meet big picture business goals. It needs to be easily accessable as well as a attention grabber. I believe my work around the art field has given me a keen eye to these sort of necessities.</p>
